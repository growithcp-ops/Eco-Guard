ROLE

Act as an award-winning experimental web designer whose work appears on Awwwards and CSS Design Awards.

This is not a corporate website.
This is a statement-driven CleanTech manifesto.

CORE IDEA

Illegal granite mining leaves behind abandoned, non-aesthetic stone waste that permanently scars the Earth.
We reclaim this waste and transform it into sustainable building materials using international-standard operations.

The website must:

Create awareness before promotion

Feel serious, calm, and impactful

Communicate responsibility over profit

Avoid all startup clichés

TYPOGRAPHY (STRICT)

Headings: Use a bold grotesk font similar to Neue Montreal / Inter Tight

Body text: IBM Plex Sans

No playful, rounded, or SaaS-style fonts

Large, editorial typography

Tight line height for headings, relaxed for body

Hero text must visually dominate the screen

Avoid fonts like Poppins, Montserrat, Lato, Nunito, Roboto.

VISUAL STYLE

Brutalist + editorial + clean-tech

Black, stone gray, off-white palette

Muted green only as an accent

Heavy use of negative space

Minimal UI, maximum meaning

Subtle scroll-based animations only when they add impact

No stock photos, no decorative graphics

PAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
1. HERO

Full-screen, no navbar initially.

Large headline:
“Earth Remembers What We Abandon.”

Small subtext:
Illegal mining doesn’t end when machines leave.

Slow fade-in animation.

2. CRITICAL DANGER

Dark background.

Short, sharp lines appearing on scroll:

Granite was extracted.

Profit was taken.

Waste was left.

Damage stayed.

No images. Text-first impact.

3. HALL OF ZERO LIMIT

Minimal, near-empty section.

Very slow scroll.
Abstract stone or grain textures.

Single line:
“Zero responsibility creates infinite damage.”

4. TRANSFORMATION

Background turns light.

Introduce the company without marketing language.

Statements like:

We don’t mine. We recover.

Waste becomes material again.

Abstract transition visuals only.

5. PROCESS

Clean grid layout.

Steps:

Recover abandoned granite

Process with international standards

Deliver sustainable building materials

No technical details. No buzzwords.

6. GRAB & GO

Strong action section.

Headline:
“If you build, you choose.”

CTAs:

Partner with us

Build responsibly

This must feel like a moral decision, not a sale.

7. VALUES

Calm, minimal section.

Statements:

Environment-first operations

Long-term responsibility

Global standards

8. FOOTER

Quiet ending.

Text only:
“Saving Earth doesn’t start with technology. It starts with responsibility.”

TECH RULES

Responsive, mobile-first

Modern HTML, CSS, JS

Smooth scrolling

Lightweight animations

High performance

Clean semantic structure

ABSOLUTE NOs

No corporate layouts

No startup marketing tone

No feature lists

No smiling people photos

No greenwashing language

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build this website as a digital environmental manifesto.
If it looks like a normal startup site, redesign it.
